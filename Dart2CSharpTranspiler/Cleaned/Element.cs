     * Defines the element model. The element model describes the semantic (as
     * opposed to syntactic) structure of Dart code. The syntactic structure of the
     * code is modeled by the [AST
     * structure](../analyzer.dart.ast.ast/analyzer.dart.ast.ast-library.html).
     *
     * The element model consists of two closely related kinds of objects: elements
     * (instances of a subclass of [Element]) and types. This library defines the
     * elements, the types are defined in
     * [type.dart](../dart_element_type/dart_element_type-library.html).
     *
     * Generally speaking, an element represents something that is declared in the
     * code, such as a class, method, or variable. Elements are organized in a tree
     * structure in which the children of an element are the elements that are
     * logically (and often syntactically) part of the declaration of the parent.
     * For example, the elements representing the methods and fields in a class are
     * children of the element representing the class.
     *
     * Every complete element structure is rooted by an instance of the class
     * [LibraryElement]. A library element represents a single Dart library. Every
     * library is defined by one or more compilation units (the library and all of
     * its parts). The compilation units are represented by the class
     * [CompilationUnitElement] and are children of the library that is defined by
     * them. Each compilation unit can contain zero or more top-level declarations,
     * such as classes, functions, and variables. Each of these is in turn
     * represented as an element that is a child of the compilation unit. Classes
     * contain methods and fields, methods can contain local variables, etc.
     *
     * The element model does not contain everything in the code, only those things
     * that are declared by the code. For example, it does not include any
     * representation of the statements in a method body, but if one of those
     * statements declares a local variable then the local variable will be
     * represented by an element.
