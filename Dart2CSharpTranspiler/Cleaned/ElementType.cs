    /**
     * Defines the type model. The type model is part of the
     * [element model](../dart_element_element/dart_element_element-library.html)
     * in that most types are defined by Dart code (the types `dynamic` and `void`
     * being the notable exceptions). All types are represented by an instance of a
     * subclass of [DartType].
     *
     * Other than `dynamic` and `void`, all of the types define either the interface
     * defined by a class (an instance of [InterfaceType]) or the type of a function
     * (an instance of [FunctionType]).
     *
     * We make a distinction between the declaration of a class (a [ClassElement])
     * and the type defined by that class (an [InterfaceType]). The biggest reason
     * for the distinction is to allow us to more cleanly represent the distinction
     * between type parameters and type arguments. For example, if we define a class
     * as `class Pair<K, V> {}`, the declarations of `K` and `V` represent type
     * parameters. But if we declare a variable as `Pair<String, int> pair;` the
     * references to `String` and `int` are type arguments.
